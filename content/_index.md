Hi! I am **Yu-Kuan Chen**, I will join the National Tsing Hua University as an Assistant Professor in Economics. I will teach at the [Department of Economics](https://econ.site.nthu.edu.tw/) and the [Taipei School of Economics and Political Science (TSE)](https://www.tse.nthu.edu.tw/).

I am an Applied Microeconomist focusing topics in education, criminal justice, and labor.

In my job market paper, I study the efficacy of minority reserves for improving gender balance in STEM programs in universities.

In my other work, I examine the effect of short-term detentions on the likelihood of future rearrests among low-risk youths. In both of these projects and others, I have always enjoyed exploring policy-relevant questions that combine data and attention to detail of the local contexts.

Feel free to contact me at: ykchen [at] mx.nthu.edu.tw
