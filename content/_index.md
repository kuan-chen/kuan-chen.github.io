Hi! I am **Yu-Kuan Chen**, a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Rice University. **I am on the 2023/24 job market** and will be available for interviews at the ASSA.

My research fields are Applied Microeconomics. I am enthusiastic about topics in **education, criminal justice, and labor**.

In my job market paper, I study the efficacy of minority reserves for improving gender balance in STEM programs in universities.

In my other work, I examine the effect of short-term detentions on the likelihood of future rearrests among low-risk youths. In both of these projects and others, I have always enjoyed exploring policy-relevant questions that combine data and attention to detail of the local contexts.
